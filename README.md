## ⚙️ Model Deep Dive

### Model 1 — XGBoost Importance Scorer

```python
# 15 hand-crafted features per email
features = [
    "sender_is_known",        # is sender in your contacts?
    "has_action_words",       # "please", "urgent", "required", "asap"
    "reply_chain_depth",      # how deep is this thread?
    "email_length_bucket",    # short = transactional, long = needs attention
    "hour_of_day",            # 3am email from boss hits different
    "has_attachment",
    "contains_deadline_language",
    "caps_ratio",             # ALL CAPS = someone is stressed
    "question_count",         # how many ?'s
    "cc_count",               # more CC'd = more visibility pressure
    # ... 5 more
]
# Output: 0–100 importance score
```

### Model 2 — Random Forest Priority Classifier

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

embedder = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
embedding = embedder.encode(email_body)  # → 384-dim vector
priority = rf_classifier.predict([embedding])  # → HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
```

### Model 3 — Deadline Extractor

```python
import dateutil.parser
import re

# Catches: "by Friday", "due 15th May", "submit before EOD", "deadline: 2026-06-01"
deadline, confidence = extract_deadline(email_text)
# confidence score included — so you know when to trust it
```

### Model 4 — K-Means Topic Clustering (Auto-K)

```python
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Don't hardcode k. Find the best k automatically.
best_k, best_score = 2, -1
for k in range(2, max_k + 1):
    labels = KMeans(n_clusters=k).fit_predict(embeddings)
    score = silhouette_score(embeddings, labels)
    if score > best_score:
        best_k, best_score = k, score

# Clusters adapt to YOUR inbox, not a preset category list
```

## 🔁 The Feedback Loop That Actually Learns

Most "AI" tools don't learn from your corrections. This one does — **immediately.**

```
You mark email as wrong priority
              │
              ▼
   Correction stored in Supabase
   with 4× sample weight
              │
              ▼
   XGBoost retrained on-the-fly
   (your correction weighted 4×
    so it actually matters)
              │
              ▼
   CASE WHEN upsert — correction
   survives Gmail resyncs
              │
              ▼
   Next similar email → correct priority ✅
```

```sql
-- The DB-aware upsert that makes corrections survive resyncs
INSERT INTO email_scores (email_id, score, is_correction)
VALUES ($1, $2, true)
ON CONFLICT (email_id) DO UPDATE
  SET score = CASE
    WHEN email_scores.is_correction = true THEN email_scores.score  -- never overwrite a correction
    ELSE EXCLUDED.score
  END;
```

## 🐛 The Data Leakage Bug (Caught & Disclosed)

The model showed **92% accuracy**. Looked amazing. Published nothing.

Something felt off.

```python
# ❌ THE LEAKY VERSION
# Training features included email metadata that only exists AFTER classification
# The model was learning from the answer, not the question
X_train = df[["subject", "body", "label_derived_feature"]]  # ← leaked target info
# Result: 92% accuracy (fake) — would collapse on real unseen emails

# ✅ THE HONEST VERSION
# Strict feature isolation — only pre-classification signals allowed
X_train = df[["subject", "body", "sender", "timestamp_features"]]
# Result: 72% accuracy (real) — actually generalises
```

**92% (fake) → 72% (honest). Caught it. Fixed it. Disclosed it.**

A model that performs at 72% honestly is infinitely more useful than one that lies at 92%.

## 🗄️ Vector Search with pgvector

```python
# Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector extension
# Cosine similarity search on 384-dim embeddings

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

CREATE TABLE emails (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  subject TEXT,
  embedding vector(384)  -- sentence-transformer output
);

-- Find similar emails to the current one
SELECT id, subject, 1 - (embedding <=> $1) AS similarity
FROM emails
ORDER BY embedding <=> $1
LIMIT 5;
```

No external vector DB. No Pinecone. Postgres does it all.

## 🔐 Multi-User Gmail OAuth2

```python
# Per-user session isolation — your emails stay yours
# Each user gets their own Gmail token, stored encrypted
# No cross-user data leakage, no shared model state

@router.get("/auth/gmail")
async def gmail_oauth(user_id: str):
    flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.Flow.from_client_secrets_file(
        CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE,
        scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"]
    )
    flow.redirect_uri = f"{BASE_URL}/auth/callback?user_id={user_id}"
    return {"auth_url": flow.authorization_url()[0]}
```
